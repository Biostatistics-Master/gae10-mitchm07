## Scenario 1: Ecology, Behavior, and Coraciiformes Color

Coraciiform species (@fig-Kingfishers) have diverse plumage coloration including pigmentary and structural colors, live in a range of different environments, show variable levels of territoriality, variability in the presence or absence of cooperative breeding (but with near uniform social monogamy), and different types of hunting strategy. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 measured plumage coloration from digital images of museum specimens and quantified several proxies for factors that could play a key role in the evolution of coloration including sex, body size, hunting strategy, habitat light environment, territoriality, and social mating system. They were interested in exploring how different possible biotic and abiotic factors may have affected the evolution of Coraciiform coloration.

### Methods:

The researchers used study skins of 117 species of Coraciiformes (families Meropidae, Brachypteraciidae, Coraciidae, Todidae, Momotidae, Alcedinidae) from the bird collections of the Natural History Museum at Tring, UK. Calibrated digital images of study skins were taken using methods described in @cooneySexualSelectionPredicts2019 and were used to quantify both chromatic (hue and saturation) and achromatic (brightness) components of color for each of several body regions (patches). The selected body regions were: crown, nape, mantle, rump, tail, wing coverts, wing primaries and secondaries, throat, breast, belly, and tail underside. They then used mapping functions to convert red-green-blue values for each patch on each specimen into values appropriate for the visual abilities of this order. Then they calculated average patch values (separately for each sex) as a species-level measure for each body patch. They then used principle components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the color data across body patches and species and found that the first principle component accounted for \>80% of the variation in color [@babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023]. @babarovicEffectsEcologyBehavior2023 then collated information on: body size; light-level associated habitat preference; hunting strategies; territoriality; and cooperative breeding from available literature.

#### Statistical Methods:

For this statistical analysis, I used a principle components analysis (PCA) to examine any patterns of coloration in bird from the order *Coraciiformes*. All analyses were conducted in R [@base] using the tidyverse, kableExtra, FactoMineR, and factoextra packages [@tidyverse; @kableExtra; @FactoMineR; @factoextra]. I created a PCA model using the 'PCA()' function from the [@FactoMineR] package, and then graphed that model on a biplot using the 'fviz_pca_ind()' and 'fviz_pca_var()' functions found in the [@factoextra] package.

```{r}
#| label: Scenario1DataImport

# I have provided the PCA1 scores for the patches (columns 2-12) as an index of
# the complex color data for each species (rows) as well as the body size (a
# quantitative supplementary variable, column 13) and ecological behavioral
# classifications (qualitative supplemental variables, columns 14-17) in
# colors.csv. Please explore any grouping and/or patterning among the species
# and their ecological/behavioral traits.

scen1data <- read_csv("colors.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
  #Show_col_types = FALSE is used to prevent R from telling you what type of data you have.

```

### Results

The major variable groups (hunting strategies, light environment, parental care, territoriality) were individually graphed on a bi-plot (not-shown below), and the hunting strategies variables, which includes the morphological variables, show the greatest level of variation between the data points and explanation of the variation. Variable groups were then visualized with ellipses representing 95% confidence intervals, which broadly overlapped, suggesting that the variables don't differ in a statistically significant manner. @fig-scen1biplot shows the morphological variables visualized using a PCA. The vectors that are closer to the x-axis are more correlated with principle component 1 (PC1), suggesting that morphological variables like crown and nape are more highly correlated with a blue plumage coloration. The vectors closer to the y-axis, especially the variables belly and breast, are suggested to be more correlated with red/green plumage coloration (PC2/Dim2).

## Scenario 2: Deer and Forest Plant Communities

White-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) are often considered to be keystone species in forest communities. @sabo2017 conducted surveys of the vegetation and environmental conditions of deer exclusion plots and adjacent plots outside the exclusion areas as part of a larger study to examine the indirect effects of their presence on the plant assemblages.

### Methods:

In Summer 2011, the researchers visited 17 deer exclosures in upland forests of northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) that were constructed for various previous studies between 1991 and 2002. In each stand, they sampled vegetation and measured key environmental variables inside the fences and in paired ‘deer-access’ plots outside the fences. The latter were in close proximity to the exclosures (always within 100 m), and were placed in locations with similar management histories and overstory structure and composition. Within each exclosure and control area, multiple quadrats were sampled and they recorded the incidence of all herbaceous, shrub, and tree seedling species.

#### Statistical Methods:

For this statistical analysis, I used a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) technique to examine any patterns of indirect impacts of white-tailed deer presence on plant assemblages. All analyses were conducted in R [@base] using the tidyverse, kableExtra, and vegan packages [@tidyverse; @kableExtra; @vegan]. I created an nMDS model using the 'metaMDS()' function found in the vegan package [@vegan]. I then used the 'adonis2' function also found in the vegan package to create a PERMANOVA model, and the 'kbl()' function found in the kableExtra package [@kableExtra] to make a PERMANOVA table.

```{r}
#| label: Scenario2DataImport

# I have provided data representing the proportion of quadrats each species
# (columns) was found in as a an index of abundance within each deer exclosure
# (rows) in Sabo_etal_data.csv.

# Use NMDS to explore the differences in plant community inside and outside the
# deer exclosures, then test for differences in the plant communities between
# the deer exclosures and the adjacent forests.

df2 <- read_csv("Sabo_etal_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### Results:

Graphs were created separately from this analysis, and the confidence intervals noticeably overlapped, therefore they were not produced and analyzed in this statistical analysis.

The correlation coefficient for the treatment is 0.011 and is not statistically significant (p = 0.989). We therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two populations are the same.

```{r}
#| label: scen2nMDS
#| results: "hide"

#Here I made a model for nMDS, removing the first two columns since they are just descriptor data, and labelling 2 dimensions since this is multi-dimensional scaling.

scen2mds <- metaMDS(
  df2[,-c(1:2)],
  k=2
)

#We want to define and check stress levels too, as low stress levels are good for our data analysis.

scen2mds$stress

#Stress is 0.159, which is greater than 0.10. This raises one alarm, but isn't awful. I changed the dimensions to k=4, and now it's 0.08.
#Trade offs: if you use more than 2 dimensions, you have to make more graphs to interpret. Or you could just reduce the dimensions back to 2 and interpret from there.
```

  df2[,-c(1,2)] ~ Treatment,
  data = df2,
  by = "margin",
  permutations = 10001
)

kbl(
